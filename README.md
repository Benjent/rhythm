Web project to learn rhythm and bits of music theory through interactive user interface.

This is a [Vue.js v3](https://vuejs.org/) project bootstrapped with [Create Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue), using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for sounds and [VexFlow](https://www.vexflow.com/) for music sheet syntax.
